### Distributed systems
- TODO

### Graph API Development
- **RESTful API** and **GraphQL** by **Spring** framework
- Implement text auto-complete, search, query to **graph database Neo4j**

### Senior Java Experiences
- Diagnosed and resolved **OutOfMemoryError** issues by analyzing heap dumps, optimizing object allocation, and fine-tuning JVM parameters, improving system stability under high-load conditions
- Tuned JVM configurations (heap size, GC, thread pool) to reduce latency and prevent memory leaks in long-running backend services

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Led cloud migration by containerizing legacy applications with Docker and deploying them to **Kubernetes** (**AWS EKS**), using **Helm** for application deployment and AWS CDK to provision cloud infrastructure — enabling scalable, portable, and fully automated environments
- Optimized Docker image size by applying multi-stage builds, minimizing dependencies, and selecting minimal, vulnerability-free base images — reducing image size by over 60%, accelerating CI/CD pipeline performance, and improving container security in production environments
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines into cloud-deployed workloads using GitLab and Helm

### Code Quality
- Refactored legacy code by applying SOLID principles and design patterns to improve code maintainability
- Improved codebase security by following Oracle Secure Coding Guidelines and integrating Aqua Trivy into the CI pipeline to identify and prevent vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle
