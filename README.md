Backend engineer with 4 years of developing and optimizing large-scale systems for low latency services. Proficient in
Java and Amazon Web Services (AWS), I have tuned API performance and led the development of 4 services using the Spring
framework. Additionally, I have contributed to the seamless migration of on-premise applications to containerized services on
AWS. As a self-motivated learner, I am committed to enhancing large-scale systems by prioritizing scalability, performance,
and minimizing latency and resource usage.
